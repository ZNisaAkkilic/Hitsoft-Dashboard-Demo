# Hitsoft-Dashboard-Demo
A Power BI dashboard prepared for Hitsoft – July 2025

# Hitsoft Performance & Client Insights – Power BI Dashboard

This dashboard was prepared as part of my job interview with Hitsoft in July 2025.

 # Key Features:
- Total Projects, Average Duration, Revenue, Satisfaction
- Industry-based analysis (Finance, Logistics, etc.)
- District-level mapping (Eyüpsultan focused)
- Team performance breakdown

 # Technologies Used:
- Power BI Desktop
- DAX (custom measures)
- Mock data created by me

# Notes:
I created this project from scratch within approximately 1 hour using a manually constructed dataset.  
It’s a simplified demo version due to time constraints, but I’m capable of producing more advanced and professional dashboards when time allows.
